# Shape

## Overview

The Shape Calculator is a Java program that allows users to calculate the area and perimeter for 2D shapes or the volume and surface area for 3D shapes. It provides a simple command-line interface for selecting different shapes and obtaining their corresponding calculations.

## Features

- Calculate area and perimeter for 2D shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Square).
- Calculate volume and surface area for 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, Pyramid).
- User-friendly interface for selecting shapes.
- Input validation to ensure the user enters valid numeric values.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
    - Compile and run the `ShapeCalculator` class.
    - The program will prompt you to select a shape by entering the corresponding number.

2. **Select a Shape:**
    - Choose from the available shapes by entering the corresponding number.
    - The program will create an instance of the selected shape.

3. **Calculate:**
    - The program will then calculate and display the area and perimeter for 2D shapes or the volume and surface area for 3D shapes.
    - If the selected shape is a 3D shape, the program will also calculate the volume.

4. **Repeat or Exit:**
    - After calculations, the program allows you to either perform calculations for another shape or exit.
